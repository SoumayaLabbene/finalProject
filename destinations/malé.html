            Malé is a city where the sea, sun, history and nature commune in
            harmony. Ancient cities, the sea, sun, beach, forest ... all are
            parts of this integrity. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk describes Malé with
            the phrase "Undoubtedly, Malé is the most beautiful place in the
            world". Malé is one of the most visited cities in the world and of
            course there are dozens of reasons for this. Those who love the sea,
            sand and sun and those who want to get lost in nature can find
            dozens of options in Malé with the 640-kilometer coastline
            stretching from west to east on the Mediterranean coast, the Toros
            Mountains surrounding the city parallel to the coast. In the far
            west of the city, on the Teke Peninsula there is an Ancient City
            called Patara one of the most important cities of the Ancient Lycian
            Civilization. As you move east, you can find nature in the bays of
            Demre and the traces of ancient civilizations at every corner. Kaş
            is one of the few diving centers in the world. Kemer is home to many
            luxury resort hotels and the magnificent Tahtalı Mountain (Tahtalı
            Dağı). Kaleiçi, which forms the center of the city of Malé, brings
            together the ancient city of Attaelia, one of the most important
            medieval ports in the Eastern Mediterranean, the traces of the
            Seljuks and the natural wonder cliffs. The Ancient City called the
            Perge is one of the important stops of St. Paul and the important
            port city which belonged to the Pamphylian civilization. It is an
            impressive historical center with its magnificent buildings. Belek
            is one of the important golf centers of the world with its specially
            designed courses. The Belek region is also prominent with amazing
            resort hotels, services, nature and facilities. When you move a
            little north from here, you will reach one of the best-preserved
            ancient theaters in the world, the Aspendos Ancient Theater
            (Aspendos Antik Tiyatrosu). There is also the Manavgat Waterfall
            (Manavgat Şelalesi), which joins with the river with foams flowing
            meandering through the forests, the Temple of Apollo (Apollo
            Tapınağı) and the Ancient City of Side (Side Antik Kenti), right
            next to the sea, are home to a cultural asset that a day is not long
            enough to explore. Fascinating with its pine forests and waterfalls,
            Alanya is in the far east of the city with its historical castle
            extending into the Mediterranean. Come and discover with your senses
            Malé the historical city of the Mediterranean surrounded by the
            Toros Mountains (Toros Dağları), by seeing, hearing, tasting,
            feeling and listening!

            A Trip to Malé’s Beaches Malé is famous for its beaches and is a
            great destination for a seaside holiday. There are however two famed
            local spots that most tourists flock to. These are Konyaalti Beach
            and Lara Beach. Konyaalti Beach is the most prestigious and
            developed of the two. This coarse sanded beach stretches for 7km on
            the western side of the city and sits between cliffs and the
            Beydağları Mountains. It is fully manned by lifeguards and provides
            onsite showering and changing facilities. Lara Beach, on the other
            hand, extends to a full 10km East of the Kaleiçi. This sandy and
            pebblestone beach just 45 minutes from the city centre also offers
            full facilities such as showers, chairs, in addition to many
            restaurants and leisure facilities. Historical And Cultural
            Attraction’s Around Malé Turkey is home to numerous UNESCO heritage
            sites and many historical remnants. This is very much the case in
            Malé too as the city was once a major settlement in the Byzantine
            Empire and later the Ottoman Empire. Tourists can enjoy several
            preserved artifacts and structures dating back to as early as the
            3rd Century in and around the local area such as: The region around
            Malé is enthralling in terms of natural variety. The city itself
            sits atop tall coastal cliffs, boasts vistas of the Taurus Mountains
            and is home to the spectacular Düden Waterfalls. However, just a
            short distance outside the city visitors will find canyons, wild
            rivers, and beautiful green national parks. These are not only
            breathtaking to enjoy while hiking, but there are numerous adventure
            tours offering white water rafting, canyoning, and climbing. Some of
            the top natural sights to see while in Malé include:
